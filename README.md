# NumberWords
This program converts words representing numbers into their numerical form, and vice-versa:

21019840572 <--> twenty one billion nineteen million eight hundred forty thousand five hundred seventy two

### Important Notes
* Decimals are not currently supported, but probably will be in the future.
* Only supports numbers in the range Â±999,999,999,999,999 (one less than one quintillion). This program's implementation requires an arbitrary cutoff point, and the quintillions begin to exceed the capacity of a 64-bit integer.

## Numbers to Words
### Usage
`python nw.py [-s]`

### Format
The given number cannot contain any punctuation, except for commas, which are optional.

Using incorrect format will result in an error message.

### Command line options
If the sign flag `-s` is enabled, results will always include a sign, even if the number is positive.
* Without `-s`: one thousand two hundred nine
* With `-s`: positive one thousand two hundred nine

## Words to Numbers
### Usage
`python wn.py [-c] [-s]`

### Format
Words must be provided in a proper order and format. All words must be separated by either a space or a hyphen (-) and they must be ordered and spelled correctly. Note that case does not matter and extra words such as "and" are fine and will be stripped out. 

Examples of **correct** format:
* `three`
* `negative twelve`
* `four hundred and twenty-six`
* `Six Hundred Thousand`
* `three hundred sixty seven billion four hundred million six thousand forty`

Examples of **incorrect** format:
* `one thousand four million` ("Thousand" cannot proceed "million")
* `hundred thousand` (A number must proceed "hundred," such as "one hundred" or "four hundred")
* `one forty seven` (If the intention is to represent the number 147, the word "hundred" must be included, such as "one hundred forty seven")

Using incorrect format will result in undefined behavior.

### Command line options
If the comma flag `-c` is enabled, results will be formatted with comma separation.
* Without `-c`: 21019840572
* With `-c`: 21,019,840,572

If the sign flag `-s` is enabled, results will always include a sign, even if the number is positive.
* Without `-s`: 1209
* With `-s`: +1209
